# Dream Team Builder

My Program is called **Dream Team Builder** which is based off the commonly know professional hockey league also know as the NHL.

It will demonstrate a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express as well as some others. The program is pretty self explanatory, theres many things you can do from checking stats to putting together your very own dream team.
